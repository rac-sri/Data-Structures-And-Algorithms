A Radix sort algorithm utilizing Counting sort as an intermediate stable sorting algorithm is to be implemented to arrange contents of an array in decreasing order. In addition to the final sorted contents of an array, also show the array contents after completing each of the Radix sortâ€™s iterations.

Input:
Line 1 contains an integer N, the size of an array.
Line 2 contains N space separated integers, the contents of an array.
Output:
Output of each intermediate step should be on a separate line. Each line should have N space separated integers, i.e. the contents of an array.
Sample Input:
10
651 329 45 32 839 20 355 6 9 436
Sample Output:
329 839 9 6 436 45 355 32 651 20
355 651 45 839 436 32 329 20 9 6
839 651 436 355 329 45 32 20 9 6
